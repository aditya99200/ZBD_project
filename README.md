Recommended Strategies
Double Down on Retargeting: Given its high revenue and low touchpoint requirements, investing more in retargeting can maximize ROI.
Optimize Marketing Channel Spend: Focus more budget on high-performing channels like Google Ads and Instagram while reconsidering low-performing ones.
Improve Conversion for New Users: Since new user promotions require more touchpoints, optimizing onboarding, simplifying purchase flows, or offering better first-time discounts may help.
Target High-Value Users: Identify users contributing the most revenue and offer exclusive deals, loyalty programs, or personalized recommendations.
Refine Reward Strategy: Instead of increasing rewards broadly, use data to provide incentives where they have the most impact.
